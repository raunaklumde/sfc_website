# ⚠️ Note on Formatting Differences (Rentry vs GitHub)
Please be aware that Rentry uses a different flavor of Markdown compared to GitHub. Some formatting elements—such as headings, links, lists, and code blocks—may render differently when viewed on Rentry.
This, as result, applies to the "web.md" file on the Repo. Please be aware of this.
